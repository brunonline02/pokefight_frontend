# pokefight_frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository for the turn-based Pokemon game inspired by the Gameboy games! This frontend was built using React and serves as the interface for the game, while the backend is handled by the companion project at https://github.com/brunonline02/pokefight_backend.

### Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, clone this repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. You can then run the app locally using npm start. The app should be available at http://localhost:5173/.

The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API calls to endpoints such as /pokemon and /pokemon/:id. Make sure to have the backend running on a separate server or port to enable communication between the two projects.

This frontend provides a user interface for selecting a Pokemon, starting battles, and viewing the results. It also displays information about each Pokemon, including its name, type and HP. Additionally, users can choose which move to use during battles and see the results of each turn.

We hope you enjoy playing this turn-based Pokemon game! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on this repository.
